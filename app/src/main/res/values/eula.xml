    <h1>End User Licensing Agreement</h1>
    By using Sky Map, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.
    \"We\" and \"Sky Map Devs\" refers to the authors and contributors to the Sky Map codebase.
    \"The App\" refers to the Sky Map application.
    <br/><br/>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    Sky Map comes with no warranties!
    If you choose to use it to navigate the high seas and you
    hit an iceberg, it\'s your responsibility. If you tell your kids that the bright thing in
    the sky is Jupiter and it turns out to be a UFO and you are subsequently kidnapped by
    aliens - not our responsibility.  If your kids subsequently fail their science homework -
    not our responsibility.  If it wipes all the data in your phone, including the photos of the UFO
    that were going to make you rich - not our responsibility.  If it causes your phone to
    tear a hole in the fabric of space and time, OK - that one is on us.  Any other calamities
    not listed above - not our responsibility.  Don\'t use it while driving or carrying scissors.

    <br/><br/>
    Boring legalese version follows.

    OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER SKY MAP DEVS
    NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE APP.
    FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE APP,

    YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE APP “AS IS”.<br/>

    SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY,

    If you do not agree to the modified terms you should discontinue your use of the app.
    If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms
    will control for that conflict.

    If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean
    that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).

    If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.

    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    This App uses Google Analytics to help analyse how people use it.
    Google Analytics collects standard internet log information and visitor behaviour information
    in an anonymous form. Note that the data is anonymous - no personally identifiable information
    is collected.  This anonymous information
    is transmitted to Google – not the Sky Map developers. Google Analytics then compiles
    statistical reports that tell us things like the percentage of users that use certain features,
    have particular versions of Android or have phones that have certain features (such as a gyroscope).
    This is essential for us to discover which features
    people like and dislike and when we can drop support for obsolete versions of Android
    and thus make Sky Map better.  We might share these reports with third parties.<br/>
    We respect your privacy and do not collect your personal information - we cannot tell anything about
    you as a user. If you do not
    wish to share this anonymous data with Google Analytics you can opt out via the settings menu.
    Otherwise, thank you for helping make Sky Map better. For more information on
    Google Analytics see  https://www.google.com/analytics/
