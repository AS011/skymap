Your phone is reporting to Sky Map that its internal compass is uncalibrated. This is not a Sky Map
    issue, but we can help you try to fix it.

 <p/>
To calibrate, move your phone as follows:
<ul>
    <li>Tilt your phone forward and back
    <li>Move it side to side
    <li>And then tilt left and right
</ul>
Repeat until the compass accuracy is medium or high.  If this does not work try the
    &quot;figure of 8&quot; method (<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP3d00Hr14o'>video</a>).
